# New Relic + GitHub Sponsors Governance

Sponsorship selection will be made by a cross-organization steering committee. The committee's responsiblity will be to ensure that sponsorship selection aligns with New Relic's company values as well as the program's mission and that the sponsorship amount is appropriate.

The steering committee will be made up of New Relic employees or approved representatives from (in alphabetical order):
* Developer Relations
* Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
* Engineering
* Marketing
* NewRelic.org
* Open Source Program Office
* Product

## Meeting cadence
Steering committee meetings will be held once-monthly and not exceed 30 minutes in length. They will be scheduled as near the 20th of the month as possible but according to member schedules.

## Selection process
### Voting
* Each month's nominee list will be distributed to members prior to the monthly steering committee meeting and be open to all members for notes and recommendations.
* Members will vote for each nominee (yes/no), and, if yes, what amount from that month's fund allocation they believe the nominee should get.
* Voting will be open for 7 days following the monthly steering committee meeting.
### Sponsorship selection and amount
* If a nominee receives greater than 50% of submitted votes, the nominee will receive sponsorship funds that month.
* The amount of sponsorship funds a selected nominee receives will be weighted based the amounts members entered during voting.
* Sponsorships will be made via GitHub Sponsors before the last day of each month.
### Non-standard sponsorships
* A recurring sponsorship (e.g. $500 per month for 3 months) may be nominated by members only. If selected, that amount will deplete the fund for each month the sponsorship recurs.
* New Relic-coordinated sponsorships (e.g. $1000 for the winner of a New Relic-sponsored hackathon), up to $5000, may be nominated by members only. If selected, that amount will deplete the fund for the quarter in which it occurs.
